Current observations of gravitational wave events from compact binary mergers are unable to resolve the tension amongst various formation models proposed 
in the literature, and thus, their formation and evolution mechanism remains elusive. 
The detection of an eccentric binary system could be vital in constraining uncertainties in these models.
In this paper, we present our results from the first-ever search for aligned spin eccentric neutron star-black hole (NSBH)
and the most sensitive search for aligned-spin eccentric binary neutron star (BNS) systems using data from the third observing run of the advanced LIGO and advanced VIRGO detectors.
No new statistically significant candidate is found, but as a result, we place the most stringent upper limits on the merger rates at the $90\%$ confidence level. 
Furthermore, we also estimate upper limits for networks of future second or third-generation observatories and conservatively predict that under null detection, 
detector networks with $X (Y)$ would require an observation time of $Z (T)$ days to constrain all plausible models of eccentric BNS or NSBH models.<br>

A preprint version of the paper is available on arXiv. This release contains the following:
* Configuration files of the search, template bank and the injections used for the analysis.
* The search sensitivity as a function of mchirp and eccentricity. 
* Jupyter-lab notebooks to obtain the 90 % upper limits using eccentric and mchirp distributions for a given model
