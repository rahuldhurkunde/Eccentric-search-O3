## This directory contains the scripts and results used to obtain the observational constraints of our search.

Below is a brief description for each sub-directory here:



* _Injection_results_ – _contains the injections files in .hdf format that were used in our search.
* _library_ – contains the python scripts that estimate the sensitive distance for given set of injections.
* _Pop-models_ – _contains the mchirp and eccentricity distributions from four different astrophysical models
    * `` DISCLAIMER “ : Please note that the mchirp and eccentricity distributions used for the four astrophysical models were derived from histograms in the referenced paper. These results are not our original work, and full credit goes to the original authors of the paper.
        * BNS in isolated channel – K. Belczynski et al. Astron. Astrophys. 615, A91 (2018).
        * NSBH in globular clusters – Manuel Arca Sedda, Commun. Phys. 3, 43 (2020).
        * NSBH in hierarchical triples – Alessandro Alberto Trani, Sara Rastello, Ugo N. Di Carlo, Filippo Santoliquido, Ataru Tanikawa, and Michela Mapelli, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 511, 1362–1372 (2022).
        * NSBH in nuclear clusters – Giacomo Fragione, Evgeni Grishin, Nathan W. C. Leigh, Hagai. B. Perets, and Rosalba Perna, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 488, 47–63 (2019).
* _psds_ – contains the representative O3 noise curve and the anticipated noise curve for the upcoming and future observatories used in this analysis.
